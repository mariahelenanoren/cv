## Web portfolio

A personal web portfolio featuring some of my previous projects, information about myself and my merits.

Built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The design is colorful yet simple, and small details like a scroll animation on the projects makes the website come to life. The grid layout for the projects are created using CSS columns. Everything else is positioned with flex. 

The pattern used for the background is generated through [PatternPad](https://patternpad.com/editor.html).
