## Web portfolio

Built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The design is colorful yet simple, and small details like a scroll animation on the projects make the website come to life. The grid layout for the projects are created using CSS columns. Everything else is built using flex. 

The pattern used for the background is generated through [PatternPad](https://patternpad.com/editor.html).
